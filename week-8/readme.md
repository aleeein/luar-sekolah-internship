Added admin role and user role. Also their login sessions are separate but the login page are the same. Just use the admin login credentials and will go straight to admin dashbooard.

For now, the admin dashboard allows admin does crud operation on the programs and could also look at the users data. The admin could look at the manage data menu in the navbar, accessible to admin only.

The login credentials for admin are :
- Email : ```admin@gmail.com```
- Password : ```admin```
